# v0 Design System

A foundational design system for teaching purposes, aimed at creating consistent, accessible, and efficient user interfaces. This system provides a single source of truth for design decisions, enabling faster development and a cohesive brand experience.

# ✨ Purpose

This Design System serves to:

* Ensure Consistency: Provide a unified visual language and interaction patterns across all products and platforms.

* Accelerate Development: Offer reusable components and clear guidelines to speed up UI development.

* Improve Quality: Promote best practices for accessibility, performance, and maintainability.

* Foster Collaboration: Bridge the gap between design and development teams with shared resources and documentation.

# 🚀 Getting Started

To use this Design System in your project, follow these steps:

**1. Installation**

You can install the design system components and tokens as a package (if published) or directly integrate them into your project.

If published as an npm package:

```
npm install @your-org/design-system
# or
yarn add @your-org/design-system
# or
pnpm add @your-org/design-system
```

If integrating directly (e.g., for monorepos):

You'll typically import components and tokens from the `src` directory.

**2. Usage**

**Using Components**

Import components into your React (or other framework) files:

```
import { Button, Card } from '@your-org/design-system'; // If published
// OR
import { Button } from './src/components/Button'; // If direct import

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

**Using Design Tokens**

You can access design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) through CSS variables, JavaScript objects, or other formats generated from the tokens directory.

Example (CSS Variables):

```
:root {
  --color-primary-500: #1a73e8;
  --spacing-md: 16px;
}

.my-element {
  background-color: var(--color-primary-500);
  padding: var(--spacing-md);
}
```

**Example (JavaScript)**:

```
import tokens from '@your-org/design-system/tokens'; // If published
// OR
import tokens from './src/tokens'; // If direct import

console.log(tokens.colors.primary[500]); // #1a73e8
```

# 🎨 V0 Integration Notes

This design system structure is designed to be flexible. The initial design elements and components for this system were generated using V0.

**To integrate your V0-generated code**:

1. **Extract V0 Code**: From our V0 chat [session](https://v0.dev/chat/update-design-tokens-cfdhvoANDIW), copy the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/React code.

2. **Place Tokens**: If V0 provided specific token values (e.g., color hex codes, spacing units), integrate them into the `src/tokens/` directory. You might create `colors.json`, `spacing.json`, etc., based on V0's output.

3. **Place Components**:

* For each component V0 generated (e.g., a Button, a Card), create a new sub-directory under `src/components/` (e.g., `src/components/Button/`).

* Place the component's code (e.g., Button.jsx) and its associated styles (e.g., Button.module.css or Tailwind classes directly in JSX) within that directory.

4. **Update Exports**: Ensure your `src/components/index.js` and `src/tokens/index.js` files correctly export the new components and tokens you've added.

5. **Refine & Document**: Review the V0-generated code for best practices and integrate it seamlessly with the rest of your design system. Crucially, document each component in the `docs/components/` directory, explaining its purpose, props, and examples.
